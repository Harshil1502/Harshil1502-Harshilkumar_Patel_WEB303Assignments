                    Shiva (Siva) is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and is considered a member
                    of the holy
                    trinity (trimurti) of Hinduism with Brahma and Vishnu. A complex character, he may represent
                    goodness,
                    benevolence and serve as the Protector. He is also associated with Time, and particularly as the
                    destroyer
                    and creator of all things.

                    In Hinduism, the universe is thought to regenerate in cycles (every 2,160,000,000 years). Shiva
                    destroys the
                    universe at the end of each cycle which then allows for a new Creation. Shiva is also the great
                    ascetic,
                    abstaining from all forms of indulgence and pleasure, concentrating rather on meditation as a
                    means to find
                    perfect happiness. He also has a darker side as the leader of evil spirits, ghosts and as the
                    master of
                    thieves, villains and beggars. Shiva is the most important Hindu god for the Shaivism sect, the
                    patron of
                    Yogis and Brahmins, and also the protector of the Vedas, the sacred texts.

                    Vishnu is one of the most important gods in the Hindu pantheon and considered a member of the
                    holy trinity
                    (trimurti) of Hinduism with Brahma and Shiva. Vishnu is the Preserver and guardian of men, he
                    protects the
                    order of things (dharma) and he appears on earth in various incarnations (avatars) to fight
                    demons and to
                    maintain cosmic harmony.

                    Vishnu is the most important god of Vaishnaism, the largest Hindu sect. Indeed, to illustrate
                    Vishnu's
                    superior status, Brahma is, in some accounts, considered to have been born from a lotus flower
                    which grew
                    from Vishnu's naval. Vishnu was married to Lakshmi (the goddess of good fortune), Sarawati (the
                    goddess of
                    wisdom) and Ganga (the goddess who is the personification of the River Ganges). However, unable
                    to live with
                    the quarrels between his three wives, Vishnu eventually sent Ganga to Shiva and Sarawati to
                    Brahma. In some
                    accounts, another wife of Vishnu's is Bhumi-Devi (goddess of the Earth). He is considered to
                    live in the
                    city of Vaikuntha on Mt. Meru, where everything is made of shining gold and fabulous jewels and
                    where there
                    are lakes resplendent with lotus flowers.

                    Brahma is the Hindu creator god. He is also known as the Grandfather and as a later equivalent
                    of Prajapati,
                    the primeval first god. In early Hindu sources such as the Mahabharata, Brahma is supreme in the
                    triad of
                    great Hindu gods which includes Shiva and Vishnu.

                    Brahma, due to his elevated status, is less involved in picturesque myths where gods take on
                    human form and
                    character but is rather a generally abstract or metaphysical ideal of a great god. In later
                    Puranas (Hindu
                    epics) Brahma is no longer worshipped and other gods are assigned his myths, even if he always
                    maintains his
                    status as the creator god. Brahma's epithet is ekahamsa, the One Swan. His vahanam ('vehicle')
                    is a peacock,
                    swan or goose. He is still honoured today with an annual ceremony at the pilgrimage site of
                    Pushkar in
                    Rajasthan, India and he remains a popular figure in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and
                    Bali.

                    Ravana is the mythical multi-headed demon-king of Lanka in Hindu mythology. With ten heads and
                    twenty arms, Ravana could change into any form he wished. Representing the very essence of evil, he
                    famously fought and ultimately lost a series of epic battles against the hero Rama, seventh avatar
                    of Vishnu.

                    An Asura from the Puranic Scriptures of the Hindu dharma, as the king of Daityas, had obtained the
                    boon from Brahma of being virtually indestructible. But as time passed by, he grew arrogant and
                    demanded that all worship him and only him considering himself to be the greatest of the gods. When
                    Prahlada, his own son refused to do so, tales have it that he attempted multiple assassinations of
                    Prahalada. Hiranyakashipu was subsequently slain by Narasimha Avatara of Lord Vishnu.

                    Also known as, Indrajit, born to the King of Lanka, Ravana and his wife Mondadori, was the conqueror
                    of Indra Lok, the highest of the heavens, and according to some accounts is considered as the
                    greatest warriors of all time. A mighty Marathi warrior who possessed the almighty Bhramastra, a
                    weapon created by the Brahman, the supreme of all, he played a prominent role in the great war
                    between Rama and Ravana. Indrajit was the eldest son of Ravana and his wife Mandodari.
